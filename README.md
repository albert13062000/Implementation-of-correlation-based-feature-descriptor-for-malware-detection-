# Correlation-Based-Feature-Descriptor-for-Malware-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning

This is a final year project worked on by Albert Ankomah Dodoo and Michael Koranteng

1. Introduction:
This repository contains the implementation and research paper for the "Correlation-based Feature Descriptor for Malware Detection using Deep Learning." In this research, we propose a novel feature descriptor that leverages correlation-based techniques and deep learning models to improve malware detection accuracy.

2. Motivation:
Malware detection is a critical task in cybersecurity to protect systems and networks from malicious software. Traditional signature-based methods often struggle to keep up with the rapidly evolving malware landscape. Feature-based techniques combined with deep learning have shown promising results in recent years. However, designing effective feature descriptors that capture the essence of malware patterns remains a challenge. This research aims to address this issue by introducing a correlation-based feature descriptor.

3. Dataset:
We used a diverse and extensive dataset for training and evaluation. The dataset contains a wide range of malware samples collected from various sources and families. It includes benign files as well to ensure a comprehensive analysis of the proposed feature descriptor.

# Our Additions to the study

The second dataset (Android malware dataset) was imbalanced. It contained unequal proportions of benign and malware samples. To address this issue, we used Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to address this issue. 
What SMOTE does is to identify the minority class and find its nearest neighbours. Afterwards synthetic examples are created to handle the issue of imbalance.

Again, we performed resampling on the dataset to solve the issue of bias.

These two additions helped to increase the accuracy levels of the module to a significant amount.
